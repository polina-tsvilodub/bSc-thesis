\chapter*{Abstract}
\pt{The abstract will be updated when all results are in}

Understanding gradable adjectives like “big” requires making reference to a so-called comparison class - a set of objects the referent is implicitly compared to. For example, the utterance ‘“That Great Dane is big” could mean “That Great Dane is big compared to dogs in general” or “That Great Dane is big compared to other Great Danes”; yet the comparison class is rarely stated explicitly. So how do listeners establish the comparison class, given multiple a priori reasonable options?
Research on gradable adjectives has focused on the representation and integration of comparison classes into compositional semantics, but little is known about how human listeners decide upon a comparison class. 
This work takes a functional perspective on comparison class inference, guided by informational goals that speakers pursue when producing an utterance with a gradable adjective, and how listeners expect these goals to be achieved syntactically. For instance, given simple “Subject Predicate” sentences listeners expect that the subject aids reference (i.e., identifies the target), whereas the predicate accomplishes predication (i.e., asserts a property of the subject). Therefore, a noun appearing in the predicate is more likely to be intended to constrain the comparison class, whereas a noun in the subject can be explained away as intended for reference, leaving comparison class inference to other pragmatic reasoning. 
Converging evidence from four behavioural experiments supporting this proposal is presented alongside a novel formalisation of the inferential account in a qualitative computational model within the Rational Speech Act framework. This work contributes to the body of research on gradable adjectives, and provides a case study of  context-dependent language, emphasizing the complexity of the relation between form and meaning of linguistic expressions.

I want to thank...

%The opportunity for this work to happen would not have been possible without the trust of three people. I would like to state my infinite gratitute to Roger Levy for providing me the chance to visit the Computational Psycholonguistics Lab for accomplishing my internship abroad, to Michael Henry Tessler for his incredible patience and great deal of time he invested in trusting me to start working on this project during the internship, and to Michael Franke for his invaluable support and guidance through this thesis and providing the ramp for my internship to happen. Furthermore, I would like to thank Carina Kauf, Maximilian Gartz, Berit Reise and Lukas Schießer for their feedback on this work. Finally, I would like to thank the anonymous CogSci reviewers and the audience at CogSci 2020 for their insightful comments and questions.
