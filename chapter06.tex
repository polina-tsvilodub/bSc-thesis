Humans use language across infinitely many different situations. By the age of two infants already learn that the same words might be used in different contexts and convey different meanings, allowing for fascinatingly versatile and efficient language use \parencite{Mintz2002, ebeling1994children}. 
Relative gradable adjectives are one, but not the only, example of natural language expressions whose meaning greatly depends on context (e.g., next to \textcite[indexicals][]{braun2017}; or \textcite[anaphoras][]{goldberg2017one}, inter alia). Yet speakers almost never establish explicitly which aspects of context are relevant and leave it to the listener to pragmatically reconstruct. Interpreting gradable adjectives requires establishing a context-dependent comparison class by inferring to what aspects of (non-)linguistic context the referent is being compared. This task is relevant for the interpretation of a number of other expressions, as comparison classes are also relevant for understanding other kinds of context-sensitive language like quantifiers \parencite[e.g., "John ate \emph{many} of hot dogs",][]{scholler2017semantic} or generics \parencite[e.g., "Dogs are friendly" \emph{[relative to other animals]},][]{tessler2019language}. 

This thesis investigated the interpretation of relative gradable adjectives as a case-study of context-sensitive language and attempted to contribute to understanding how exactly listeners might establish relevant comparison classes. 
Standard literature on gradable adjective semantics suggests that the comparison class might be supplied by the noun the adjective combines with, or by relevant contextual aspects; however, this work argued that purely compositional accounts might be too rigid to explain the flexible use of gradable adjectives across contexts. Furthermore, much of the research on gradable adjective semantics eschewed the question how exactly a comparison class might be determined contextually, instead focusing on its integration into compositional semantics \parencite{Kennedy2007, kennedy2012, Kamp1975, Cresswell1976, Solt2009}. 
Therefore, this work outlined a novel functional hypothesis regarding the role a noun might have for comparison class inference in addition to contextual cues --- namely the \emph{reference-predication trade-off hypothesis}. The quintessential prediction derived from this hypothesis is that listeners are less likely to take the noun as a cue towards the comparison class when the noun can be expained away as intended for the informational goal of reference, operationalized via the syntactic position of the noun the adjective combines with. Specifically, nouns appearing in the subject of the sentence can be explained by their utility in reference and are therefore less likely to set the comparison class, while nouns in the predicate are less likely to be referential and are therefore more likely to constrain the comparison class.

Four experiments were conducted to investigate this hypothesis. Experiment 1 showed that participants appreciably disprefer sentences where a subordinate noun appeared in the predicate compared to sentences with a basic-level noun in the predicate as describing a normal-sized referent, indicating that participants preferred sentences with a more felicitous comparison class label in the predicate. Experiment 2 revealed that participants flexibly adjust their noun choices given different syntactic frames in a free-production setting, producing more basic-level nouns in the predicate than in the subject position. Experiment 3 indicated that participants are highly sensitive to the perceptual context of the utterance, to the noun of the utterance and to its syntactic position when asked to paraphrase the comparison class, trading-off the noun's utility in reference and predication when reasoning about its cue strength towards the comparison class. Finally, a pilot study for Experiment 4 showed that reasoning about informational goals accomplished by the noun is indeed the driver behind participants' reasoning about comparison classes, as opposed to mere presence of direct syntactic modification of the noun by the adjective. % Participants were more likely to infer the subordinate comparison class from directly modified subordinate nouns appearing in the predicate than in the subject position. 
Together, these experiments provide converging evidence that humans use information structure when reasoning about the comparison class, consistent with the reference-predication trade-off hypothesis. 

\pt{model summary here, criticism after expt criticism}

Experiments presented here investigated the role of perceptual context, noun type and syntactic position on comparison class inferences; while covering many major cues towards the comparison class, the particular operationalization of the hypothesis via the syntactic manipulation between subject and predicate position of the noun invites investigation of further aspects in future studies. For one, all experiments presented critical utterances in written form, yet one other factor that is closely related to information-structure is \emph{prosody} \parencite{krifka2008basic}. Prosody might provide a strategy to both structure information and construct new content: for instance, prosody realising focus of a sentence might indicate the presence of relevant alternatives for the focused expression, convey the topic of the utterance or emphasize new information \parencite{krifka2008basic, selkirk1995sentence}. 
Applied to sentences used in present studies, uttering the sentence "That Great Dane is \textsc{big}" (\textsc{big} being prosodically prominent) might convey that the speaker deems the size of this referent particularly noteworthy and therefore shifts the communicative goal towards predication - a perfectly reasonable scenario where the Great Dane is actually big \emph{for} a Great Dane, making the subordinate subject-noun the comparison class.  Alternatively, the same scenario is imaginable in a situation where someone said "That Great Dane is small" and the speaker replied "No, that Great Dane is \textsc{big}". The latter example goes in the direction of meta-linguistic or predagogical uses of gradable adjectives where the speaker informs the listener about what he considers a viable use of size adjectives given the particular referent. Uttering "That \textsc{Great Dane} is big" might signal that a Great Dane is being contrasted against other categories or referents, highlighting the referential goal of the noun.
For the predicate-N utterance prosodically different readings also seem possible in different contexts. For instance, uttering "\textsc{That}'s a big Great Dane" might contrast a particular referent against other Great Danes; or teach the listener about what the speaker considers a good representative of a big Great Dane. The latter example seems plausible in a context where e.g. other big dogs or Great Danes were previously discussed. Uttering "That's a \textsc{big} Great Dane" again seems to imply meta-linguistic or contrastive intentions, while "That's a big \textsc{Great Dane}" would highlight the noun as signalling the comaprison class. 
Generally, prosody as a tool for both information packaging and content construction might affect the question under discussion and therefore the informational goal in focus, so effects of prosody on comparison class inferences and their connection to the refernence-predication hypothesis should be addressed in future work \parencite{krifka2008basic}. 

In addition, it should be noted that this particular experimental approach was chosen in order to keep a maximally simple and controlled design. So for practical reasons of stimulus presentation only size-adjectives 'big' and 'small' were used; however, the reference-predication trade-off hypothesis is applicable to relative gradable adjectives in general, so further experiments involving other adjectives should be conducted. 
Furthermore, the experiments used stimuli from natural basic-level categories only; salient taxonomic representation of such categories might play a role for listeners' reasoning about potential comparison classes, by providing salient viable alternative comparison categories (i.e., subordinate and basic-level categories, \textcite[cf.][]{rosch1976, tenenbaum2011grow}); importantly, potentially relevant psychological differences between natural and articifical concepts have been addressed in the literature \parencite{kalish2002gold}. 
Additionally, only one specific (schematic) referent picture per subordinate category was used across experiments; future research should consider varying the pictures in order to average out potential typicality and nameability effects of these pictures as representations of those categories. Relatively high by-target random intercepts across experiments suggested that targets might have varied in those aspects (e.g., resulting in different propensities of the speakers to use subordinate labels). Running a typicality or nameability rating study on the used categories might also be useful for eliciting prior knowledge for fitting the RSA model quantitatively to observed data \parencite{franke2016does}. %Additionally, the relation of comparison classes to typicality of the target for its basic-level category should be investigated more carefully. 

Furthermore, in order to be able to create maximally symmetric utterances across different contexts and syntactic conditions, the noun phrase in the predicate position was always indefinite, and the subject noun phrase was always definite. If the predicate was definite, the triggered uniqueness presupposition would have been violated in subordinate contexts, deeming these sentences generally less natural (i.e., saying "That's \emph{the} big Great Dane" would trigger the expectation that there is only one Great Dane, which is not true of contexts used in the experiments). 
For this reason, the definiteness of the noun is perfectly confounded with its position throughout the experiments. Yet given an appropriate discourse context where there is only one individual denoted by the noun alternative utterances with a definite predicate noun could be tested. The reference-predication hypothesis would predict that definite nouns in the predicate might still be more likely to establish the comparison class than subject nouns irrespective of their higher referential value compared to indefinite ones, as long as reference was already established in the subject. 
The hypothesis, however, does not seem to be operationalized by alternative sentences where the subject noun could be indefinite, since indefinite nouns generally do not refer; these sentences might rather interface with generic or meta-linguistic uses of adjectives \parencite{Reboul2001, tessler2019language, barker2002dynamics}. 

Generally, referential pressure was not very high in current experiments. Referential purposes of the noun were mainly communicated through its combination with the deictic, and its position in the subject which might rely on general information-structural expectation (s. Chapter \ref{chapter03}). The target referent was perceptually highlighted in a separate picture throughout the experiments. The contextual referential pressure might be manipulated in further experiments, e.g., by presenting the referent as a potentially non-highlighted member of the context. 
%Another potential confound - definiteness. \pt{discuss in chapter 6 that deconfounding definiteness from syntactic manipulation should be addresses in future research; keep it maximally symmetric in E1-3; tentative predictions for E4: same distinction for "A prize-winner is a big great dane" vs "A big great dane is a prize-winner"; infelicitous presuppositions for both parts being definite; also discuss connection to plural / generics / predagogical language;}

Besides experimental evidence, this work also attempts to provide a computational model of the reference-predication hypothesis within the Rational Speech Act framework. The proposed model advances previous RSA-models of gradable adjectives by modelling qualitatively new reasoning about several aspects of meaning via structural cues.

%Developmental implications. Anna's work.

Understanding cues that contribute to gradable adjective interpretation also has various implications for investigating the developmental course of children's understanding of complex context-sensitive expression. In particular, already by the age of two infants understand adjectives like 'big' and 'small' and appreciate their context-sensitive nature, sometimes even without adults specifically pointing out the relevant features of context \parencite{Mintz2002, ebeling1994children}. That is, the critical skill to acquire is establishing the correct comparison class; while adults often use prepositional \emph{for}-phrases in child-directed speech, the phrases are often indicative of a particular kind of gradable adjective uses - the functional uses (s. Chapter 2, \textcite{ebeling1994children}). Yet when not producing a \emph{for}-phrase, adults might include other syntactic cues towards the comparison class for more ambiguous adjective uses. Taking a developmental perspective on the reference-predication hypothesis, one might derive the prediction that adults use nouns in the predicate of sentences more often than in the subject, to restrict the comparison class more strongly and make the adjective interpretation easier for children. A study wherein the Providence corpus was annotated with respect to linguistic and environmental cues available in the recorded contexts provides preliminary evidence that the majority of recorded uses of the adjective 'big' were indeed prenominal cases where the modified nominal appears in the predicate of the sentence \parencite{sinelnikova2020}. 
Moreover, it showed that more modified nouns appeared in the predicate when there were less distractors in the context; when there were more perceptual distractors the modified noun was rather placed in the subject, contributing to reference. Furthermore, it was found that the referent was mostly physically copresent when the noun was used in the predicate, suggesting that reference might have been established by means other than the noun (e.g., pointing). Finally, the intended comparison class for the adjective-nominal predicate constructions was overwhelmingly the normative comparison class (i.e., making reference to implicit general knowledge of the abstract basic-level  category of the referent, mostly denoted by the noun, s. Chapter \ref{chapter02}), indicating that these syntactic frames were used when establishing the comparison class might have been more challenging for the children. These preliminary results are consistent with predictions of the reference-predication trade-off hypothesis ---  nouns in the predicate seem to communicate the comparison class of a referent, facilitating understanding of the gradable adjective for kids who might lack other means for pragmatic reasoning like substantial world knowledge. 
Understanding what kinds of cues are available to children in naturalistic settings might provide a starting point for investigating how they succeed in learning context-sensitive expressions. 

To sum up, the reference-predication trade-off hypothesis of comparison class inference highlights the complex relation of an utterance meaning and its form.

\section{Conclusion}
% Interface between syntax, semantics and pragmatics. first work to attempt to integrate influences from different sources of information for the comparison class. connection to other context-depending linguistic phenomena; case study for context-dependence and vagueness

In conclusion, this thesis undertook a step towards further understanding of how interlocutors use relative gradable adjectives. Integrating evidence from different information sources, humans perform sophisticated reasoning at the interface of syntax, semantics and pragmatics in order to establish comparison classes. It was shown that humans reason about referential utility of the noun in context and trade it off with the noun's utility in communicating the comparison class. This case-study of vague language provides a fascinating example for how humans can accomplish big goals by harnessing a small but powerful set of pragmatic reasoning skills.
