\pt{Bullshit yet} Humans use language across infinitely many different situations. During infancy already they learn that the same words might be used in different contexts and convey meanings, producing a fascinatingly versatile and efficient language. 
Relative gradable adjectives are one, but not the only, example of natural language expressions whose meaning greatly depends on context (e.g., next to \textcite[indexicals][]{braun2017}; or \textcite[anaphoras][]{goldberg2017one}, inter alia). Yet speakers almost never establish explicitly which aspects of context are relevant and leave it to the listener to pragmatically reconstruct.  Interpreting gradable adjectives requires establishing a context-dependent comparison class --- and this work attempted to contribute to understanding how exactly listeners might accomplish that. In addition, comparison classes are relevant for understanding other kinds of context-sensitive language like quantifiers \parencite{scholler2017semantic} or generics \parencite{tessler2019language}. 

This thesis investigated the interpretation of relative gradable adjectives as a case-study of context-sensitive language. In particular, this work outlined a novel functional hypothesis regarding the role a noun might have on comparison class inference --- the \emph{reference-predication trade-off hypothesis}. The quintessential prediction derived from this hypothesis is that listeners are less likely to take the noun as a cue towards the comparison class when the noun can be expained away as intended for reference, operarationalized via asyntactic manipulation of the noun position. 

Four experiments were conducted to investigate this prediction. Experiment 1 showed that participants appreciably disprefer sentences where a subordinate noun appeared in the predicate compared to sentences with a basic-level noun in the predicate as describing a normal-sized referent, indicating that participants preferred sentences with a more felicitous comparison class label in the predicate. Experiment 2 revealed that participants flexibly adjust their noun choices given different syntactic frames in a free-production setting, producing more basic-level nouns in the predicate than in the subject position. Experiment 3 indicated that participants are highly sensitive to the perceptual context of the utterance, to the noun of the utterance and to its syntactic position when asked to paraphrase the comparison class, trading-off its utility in reference and predication when reasoning about its cue strength towards the comparison class. Finally, a pilot study for Experiment 4 showed that reasoning about informational goals accomplished by the nouns is indeed the driver behind participants' reasoning about comparison classes more so than presence of direct syntactic modification of the noun by the adjective. % Participants were more likely to infer the subordinate comparison class from directly modified subordinate nouns appearing in the predicate than in the subject position. 
Together, these experiments provide converging evidence that humans use information-structure when reasoning about the comparison class, consistent with the reference-predication trade-off hypothesis. 

Experiments presented here investigated the role of perceptual context, noun type and syntactic position on comparison class inferences; while covering many major cues towards the comparison class, the particular operationalization of the hypothesis via the syntactic manipulation between subject and predicate position of the noun invites investigation of further aspects in future studies. For one, all experiments presented critical utterances in written form, yet one other factor that is closely related to information-structure is \emph{prosody} \parencite{krifka2008basic}. In particular, uttering the sentence "That Great Dane is \emph{big}" (\emph{big} being focused) might convey that the speaker deems the size of this referent particularly noteworthy and therefore shifts the communicative goal towards predication - a perfectly reasonable scenario where the Great Dane is actually big \emph{for} a Great Dane, making the subordinate subject-noun the comparison class.  Alternatively, the same scenario is imaginable in a situation where someone said "That Great Dane is small" and someone what reply "No, that Great Dane is big". The goes in the direction of meta-linguistic / predagogical uses of gradable adjectives. For the utterance "That's a big Great Dane", also prosodically different readings seem plausible in different contexts. 
All these examples seem consistent with the reference-predication hypothesis.
The effects of prosody on comparison class inferences should be addressed in future work. 

It should be noted that this particular experimental operationalization was chosen in order to keep a maximally simple and controlled design. So for practical reasons only size-adjectives 'big' and 'small' were used; however, the reference-predication trade-off hypothesis is applicable to relative gradable adjectives in general, so further experiments involving other adjectives should be conducted. Furthermore, only one specific referent picture per subordinate category was used across experiments; future research should consider varying the pictures in order to control for typicality or namability effects of these pictures as representations of those categories. Relatively high by-target random intercepts across experiments suggest that targets might have varied in those aspects (e.g., resulting in different propensities of the speakers to use subordinate labels). Additionally, typicality effects of the target for its basic-level category should be controlled more carefully. 

Furthermore, in order to be able to create maximally symmetric utterances across different contexts and syntactic conditions, the noun phrase in the predicate position was always indefinite. It it was definite, the triggered uniqueness presupposition would have been violated in subordinate contexts, deeming these sentences generally less natural. 
For this reason, the definiteness of the noun is perfectly confounded with its position throughout the experiment. Yet given an appropriate discourse context where there is only one individual denoted by the noun, it is plausible that definite nouns in the predicate are more likely to establish the comparison class than the definite noun in the predicate (comparable to Experimetn 3 basic-level context condition). The hypothesis, however, does not seem to be operationalized by sentences where the subject noun is indefinite, since indefinite nouns generally do not refer; they might rather interface with generics or pedagogical contexts \parencite{Reboul2001, tessler2019language}. 
 Generally, referential pressure was not very high in this experiment. Referential purposes of a noun are mainly communicated through its combining with the deictic, and its position in the subject which might rely on general information-structural expectation (s. Chapter \ref{chapter03}). Yet the target referent was generally highlighted in a separate picture throughout the experiments; the contextual referential pressure might be manipulated in further experiments, e.g., by presenting the referent as a potentially non-highlighted member of the context. 
%Another potential confound - definiteness. \pt{discuss in chapter 6 that deconfounding definiteness from syntactic manipulation should be addresses in future research; keep it maximally symmetric in E1-3; tentative predictions for E4: same distinction for "A prize-winner is a big great dane" vs "A big great dane is a prize-winner"; infelicitous presuppositions for both parts being definite; also discuss connection to plural / generics / predagogical language;}

%Use more adjectives, different pictures, consider typicality effects.  namability effects

Model stuff. 
Novel contribution of this model.   
first model to our knowledge incorporating speakers pursuing several communicative goals. 

Besides experimental evidence, this work also attempts to provide a computational model of the reference-predication hypothesis within the Rational Speech Act framework. The proposed model advances previous RSA-models of gradable adjectives by modelling qualitatively new reasoning about several aspects of meaning via structural cues. That is, the model predicts a potential state of the world (a referent and its likely property) along with the likely intended  comparison class. \pt{In particular, the pragmatic listener .... } This model makes the novel prediction about when the noun should be taken to signal the comparison class more strongly. Qualitative fit, quantitative fit?

Developmental implications. Anna's work.
Understanding cues that contribute to gradable adjective understanding has great implications for investigating the developmental course of children's understanding of complex context-sensitive expression. In particular, already by the age of two infants understand adjectives like 'big' and 'small' and appreciate their context-sensitive nature, sometimes even without adults specifically pointing out the relevant features of context \parencite{Mintz2002, ebeling1994children}. That is, the critical skill to acquire is to learn establishing the correct comparison class; while adults often use prepositional \emph{for}-phrases in child-directed speech, the phrases are often indicative of a particular kind of gradable adjective uses - the functional uses (s. Chapter 2, \textcite{ebeling1994children}). Yet when not producing a \emph{for}-phrase, adults might include other cues towards tbe comparison class. Taking a developmental perspective on the reference-predication hypothesis, one might derive the prediction that adults would use nouns in the predicate of sentences more often than in the subject, to restrict the comparison class more strongly and make the adjective interpretation easier for children. \pt{some literature on children's sensitivity towards syntactic cues / syntax?} Preliminary evidence from a study wherein the Providence corpus was tentatively annotated with respect to linguistic and environmental cues available in the recorded contexts %different uses of gradbale adjectives and respective comparison classes 
shows that the majority of uses of the adjective 'big' are indeed prenominal cases where the modified nominal appears in the predicate of the sentence \parencite{sinelnikova2020}. Moreover, more modified nouns appeared in the predicate when there were less distractors in the context; when there were more perceptual distractors the modified noun was rather placed in the subject, contributing to reference. Furthermore, it found was found that the referent was mostly physically copresent when the adjective was used in this sentence frame, suggesting that reference might have been established by means other than the noun (e.g., pointing). Finally, the intended comparison class for these uses was overwhelmingly the normative comparison class (i.e., the basic-level  category of the referent, mostly denoted by the noun, s. Chapter \ref{chapter02}). These preliminary results are consistent with predictions of the reference-predication trade-off hypothesis ---  nouns in the predicate seem to communicate the comparison class of a referent, facilitating understanding of the gradable adjective for kids who might lack other means for pragmatic reasoning like substantial world knowledge. 
Understanding what kinds of cues are available to children in naturalistic settings might contribute to investigating how they accomplish learning context-sensitive expressions.

\section{Conclusion}
Interface between syntax, semantics and pragmatics. first work to attempt to integrate influences from different sources of information for the comparison class. connection to other context-depending linguistic phenomena; case study for context-dependence and vagueness

In conclusion, this thesis undertook a step towards further understanding of how interlocutors use relative gradable adjectives. Integrating evidence from different information sources, humans perform sophisticated reasoning at the interface of syntax, semantics and pragmatics in order to establish comparison classes. It was shown that humans reason about referential utility of the noun in context and trade it off with the noun's utility in communicating the comparison class. This case-study of vague language provides a fascinating example for how humans can accomplish big goals by harnessing a small but powerful set of pragmatic reasoning skills.
