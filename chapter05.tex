The vague context-dependent nature of gradable adjective interpretation has been promisingly formalized in models within the Rational Speec Act framework \parencite{goodman2016, lassiter2017adjectival, tessler2017warm}). However, these models wither assumed an established felicitous comaprison class, or focused on simple utterances like "It's small". This chapter reviews the Rational Speech Act framework and prior models of gradable adjectives, to finally propose an extension to these existing model, incorporating the reference-predication trade-off hypothesis.
